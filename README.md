- 👋 Hi, I’m @adboon, a PhD student at the department of MTT @ TU Delft
- 👀 I’m interested in hydrodynamics, especially when offshore structures or ships are involved
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, after using MatLab during my studies
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research into green water loadings, or other extreme nonlinear wave loadings. Or forces on a cylinder in waves and currents. Or anything with waves actually
